# taquin-ai
IA project - Taquin game with an AI (A* algorithm)



## Requirement
- Rust installed [see here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).


## Launch the project 
In the root of the project, use: 
```bash
$ cargo run # launch the program
```

## Description

First you have to chose the size of the taquin:
- 3x3
- 4x4 (AI may not work for this size)

Then there is 2 method available to resolve the generated Taquin:
- By hand : to play the classic game
- with AI : you can then chose the heuristic used in the algorism
    - Manhattan heuristic
    - Hamming heuristic
